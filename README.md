# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-

What Is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm that combines:
  - Retrieval: fetching relevant content from a corpus,
  - Augmentation: adding that content as contextual grounding,
  - Generation: producing outputs from a large language model enriched with retrieved context.
In simple terms: RAG helps LLMs give more accurate, contextually grounded answers by looking up external information rather than relying only on learned parameters.
